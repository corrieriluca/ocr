Program for training the Neural Network.

There is a folder for each font.

To train the NN with samples : `make && ./learn.out <folder_name>/`
Do not forget to add a '/' after the folder name. Otherwise the program will
raise an error.

When you're done : `make clean`

Further instructions explaining where are saved the weights will be added later.
