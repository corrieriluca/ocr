Program for building the database of characters in order to train the Neural Network.

There is a folder for each font.
There are about 65k characters in the 30 Lorem ipsum samples at the root of the
repository.

The file `learning_old.c` is not used anymore.

To build the database of characters : `make all && ./build.out`

When you're done : `make clean` (this will also) remove the database (*.ocr files)

Further instructions on training and explaining where are saved the weights will be added later.
